# TIP 0: Technology Improvement Proposal

The Python community has PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals). The idea behind
TIPs are to provide proposals for standards within the Technology department of
G Adventures.

Proposals can focus on the culture, technology, or processes within our
department. Anyone within our organization can make a proposal, and anyone can
contribute to the ideas and eventual formation of it.

## Submitting a TIP

The TIP process begins with a new idea for the Technology Department. It is
generally recommended that a TIP contains a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the TIP, the more successful it tends to be.

Each TIP must have a champion -- someone who follows the ideas and/or formats
described in their TIP. Generally, what you're proposing within your TIP is
something you already live and breathe by.

To submit a TIP, please follow the instructions within [TIP 2](https://github.com/gadventures/TIPs/blob/master/tips/tip-2-submitting-tips.md)

## Goals

To unify the technology department in how we work, and interact with
our stakeholders. With this in mind, we strive towards an inclusive,
and friendly workplace, pushing the boundaries of technology.
