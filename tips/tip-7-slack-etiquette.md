Slack is a fantastic tool for real time group communications. It allows us to organize, plan and communicate with others easily. While Slack is used as a work communication tool it is also used as a social communication tool and because of this we need to be careful of how we use it.

## Behaviour

Follow our second [Core Value](https://github.com/gadventures/TIPs/blob/master/tips/tip-1-core-values.md) of "Treat others the way theyâ€™d like to be treated".

## Notifications

Slack has a wonderful feature built in called Do Not Disturb (DND) that will prevent notifications from pushing to an individual outside of work hours.  By default, we prevent notifications from pushing between the hours of 7pm and 8am, but each person can set their own work hours.  If you do DM someone outside of their work hours, you will receive a prompt that will give you the opportunity to override DND and forward the notification to them - please only do this in case of an Emergency (You can find out what constitutes an Emergency in the next section).

DND has no concept of holidays or vacations, so if you'd prefer to avoid notifications during those times, you'll need to override your personal settings.

## Distractions

Slack is a fantastic tool for near real time communications but it can get distracting quickly when you're using it's default settings. By default, Slack sends you notifications for all activity in all channels which is not ideal. You can change these settings by going to https://gadventures.slack.com/account/notifications and setting the various notification settings for Desktop/Mobile as well as specific channels.

### Recommended settings
* Change Notifications from `All Activity` to `Only Direct Messages & Highlight Words`
* Mute `#gadventures`. This channel is extremely noisy and having notifications on all activity is pointless.

While Slack is the tool we've chosen to use as our main communication tool it's not a requirement to be on it 100% of the day. It's perfectly fine to set your status as away or to close it entirely when you need to get work done. 


## Emergencies

In the case of an emergency employees are expected to be available both on slack and via other means (personal cell number, home phone, etc...).

Emergencies include but are not limited to:

* Systems being entirely offline
* CEO needing to receive money
* Passengers booking a trip
* Anything that would affect a passenger when they arrive on a trip or while they are on a trip

In the rare occasion that there's an emergency while an employee is on vacation, any costs associated with the emergency (cell phone, internet, etc...) should be billed to the company.

## Slackbot Responses

Slackbot has a wonderful feature that allows it to auto-respond to specified sayings. Slackbot will respond whenever the specified saying occurs, whether it's in a channel or DM.

Ideally, Slackbot responses should be triggered purposefully.  To that end, Slackbot responses shouldn't be created for commonly used words or phrases, names or usernames. If a Slackbot response is occurring too often, consider adding `_` before it to prevent it from being triggered accidentally.
