Slack is a fantastic tool for real time group communications. It allows us to organize, plan and communicate with others easily. While Slack is used as a work communication tool it is also used as a social communication tool and because of this we need to be careful of how we use it.

## Behaviour

Follow our second [Core Value](https://github.com/gadventures/TIPs/blob/master/tips/tip-1-core-values.md) of "Treat others the way theyâ€™d like to be treated".

## Notifications

Please be wary of how notifications can affect people, especially outside of work hours. The following are a basic set of guidelines to follow.

Do not:
* @channel, @individual person or DM an individual before 8am and after 6pm M-F
* @channel, @individual person or DM an individual during the weekend

## Emergencies

In the case of an emergency employees are expected to be available both on slack and via other means (personal cell number, home phone, etc...).

Emergencies include but are not limited to:

* Systems being entirely offline
* CEO needing to receive money
* Passengers booking a trip
* Anything that would affect a passenger when they arrive on a trip or while they are on a trip

In the rare occasion that there's an emergency while an employee is on vacation, any costs associated with the emergency (cell phone, internet, etc...) should be billed to the company.

## Slackbot Responses

Slackbot has a wonderful feature that allows it to auto-respond to specified sayings. Slackbot will respond whenever the specified saying occurs, whether it's in a channel or DM.

Slackbot respones shouldn't be created for very common words, names, usernames or phrases. If a slackbot response is ocurring to often think about adding `_` before it.
