The purpose of this TIP (Technology Improvement Proposal) is to provide the general structure for writing future TIPs. Following the structure outlined below will help ensure your TIP is approved in a timely matter.

## TIP Life Cycle

The TIP process begins with an idea to improve the Technology department. This can include topics such as style guides, culture, interview process or anything that a member of the Technology team feels should be included.

Once you've submitted your idea (via Pull Request) you can request discussion via tagging the technology group and/or posting a link in Slack.

After discussion from the department and any changes that need to be made are completed, you can merge it into master. This completes the TIP.

## General structure

All TIPs should follow a similar structure to ensure readability and reduce any confusion around the topic of the TIP.
