## 1. We’re better together

We love the problems we solve and appreciate the people we work with. 
The work we do has meaning within our department, within G, and to our customers.
 We build a better business and product by bringing different perspectives to the table. We value the participation of each team member.

We help build community/spread the word of G by:

* Sponsoring, and working with organizations which promote diversity in the field of Technology
* Sponsoring events like PyCon, Ladies Learning Code, Break Poverty Hackathon
* Teaching programming skills to anyone and everyone interested.
* Encourage each other to work on side projects, publish open source code, attend conferences and local events.

## 2. Treat others the way they’d like to be treated

We’re committed to providing a harassment-free work environment for everyone, regardless of 
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
 We do not tolerate harassment of team members, or anyone within the G Adventures organization, in any form.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please speak to your manager.

Our customers and teammates have different needs from our own, so we must consider their
 perspectives in order to communicate effectively and respectfully. We create the best products when we understand the people we are building for.


## 3. Work Smarter, Not Harder

Identify a healthy work / life balance for yourself. Iterate on your skills by 
committing to continuous learning and have a sense of adventure and open mind as 
you dig through a new technology. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, and learn 
from your co-workers. Promote new tools and ideas, and don’t hold back your thoughts (What you may feel is a silly idea today may change how we work next year.)


## 4. Lead With Service

Work to support others. You won’t be here forever, and that’s OK. Do your work
 in such a fashion that is transparent, documented, and helps others learn. 
By making the people around you better, not only will you be better, but you
 will help others achieve success and growth, building ever-lasting connections you can happily look back on.
