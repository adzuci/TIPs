# TIP 0: Technology Improvement Proposal

The Python community has PEP's (Python Enhancement Proposal's). The idea behind
TIP's are to provide proposals for standards within the Technology department of
G Adventures.

Proposals can focus on the culture, technology, or processes within our
department. Anyone within our organization can make a proposal, and anyone can
contribute to the ideas and eventual formation of it.

## Submitting a TIP

The TIP process begins with a new idea for the Technology Department. It is
generally recommended that a TIP contains a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the TIP, the more successful it tends to be.

Each TIP must have a champion -- someone who follows the ideas and/or formats
described in their TIP. Generally, what you're proposing within your TIP is
something you already live and breathe by.

To submit a TIP, please follow the instructions within [TIP 2](TODO)

## TIP Czars

These people are the ones who will work with the TIP Champion(s) to edit,
refine, and upon agreement, finalize and merge the proposal into the TIP master.
The current czars are:

* Adam McKerlie
* Bartek Ciszkowski
* Rafik Draoui
* Craig Nagy
* Danielle Jessamy
* Gino Lopez
* Joy Tan
* Les Liddell

These czars have different specialisations, experiences, and opinions. If you'd
like to help and become a czar, you should contribute to the discussion of as
much proposals as you can :)

## Goals

To unify the technology department in how we work, and interact with
our stakeholders. With this in mind, we strive towards an inclusive,
and friendly workplace, pushing the boundaries of technology.
